1.why must we choose you? 
Not going with a answer thats really cliache and just prasing myself i would just say that i am really smart working student(a little hard working).if i do commit for 
a task i dont skip and hop and jump, i do take rest only after completing it.i do have a little obsession of taking things to perfection may not be absolute  perfection 
but atleast near  to perfection.there is no promising answer why you people should choose me but i promise that i will work with fullest potential if i get selected 

2.whay is your plan for next 6 months ?
since i have started cs50 (dueation 5 months) course run by the prestigeous havard university i will be completing it first then after having a good knowledge about things i wil 
participate in many projects and just learn and learn deep into the subject 

3.how would you contrigute back to the club?
to be fair i do really have no idea about this thing...but i guess that if i grow up really good with the club i will welcome a good amont of name and fame to the club...other 
than this i think that i will be helping my juniors who would aspire to join this club in upcoming future 

4.Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
i loved the task given by you guys which and how you people also cared about stuedents like me who are really new to programming....overall it was awesome.
